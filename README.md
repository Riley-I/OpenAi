# Random Response Generator - OpenAi Challenge

## Description

GPT-3 is a powerful AI model created by OpenAI. It can process plain text prompts and produce outputs that are hard to distinguish from human writing. Check out some examples of what it can do! GPT-3 can be accessed through a public API that includes a generous amount of free credits. 

## Challenge

You will write an app that sends plain text prompts to the OpenAI API and displays the results in a list.

    -We'd like your app to have a simple-to-use interface that includes the following:
    -A form for entering text prompts
    -Submitting the form sends the prompt to the OpenAI API
    -Results are displayed in a list, sorted from newest to oldest. Each result should include the original prompt and a response from the API.


Bootstrap was used for the front end framework and styled with custom CSS.
